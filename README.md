# Grid-tied inverter simulation and analysis

A program for simulation and analysis of grid-tied inverters. Considering an output stage consisting of a half-bridge voltage source inverter (VSI) and an output LCL filter, it allows evaluating the operation of such electronic device for high-frequency switching and under different load conditions.

The program contains the following file types:
- **MATLAB** scripts for general settings and controller design
- **Simulink** implementation for digital-control simulation
- **PSIM** implementation for power-electronics simulation

Main file named as 'run_grid_tied.m'.
